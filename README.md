Sample Charge Token Backend
====

This is a really simple [NODE](http://www.nodejs.com/) webapp that you can use to test Paystack's sample mobile apps.

It has a single endpoint, `/charge`, which takes 3 parameters (`token`, `email` and `amountinkobo`) to create a charge on your Paystack account.

This is intended as a sample only: you'll likely need something more serious for your production apps.

To deploy this for free on Heroku, click this button:

Then make your apps post to the url heroku provides e.g. jingle-bells.heroku.com.

Happy testing!
